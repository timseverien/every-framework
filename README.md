# Every framework

This is a repository where I experiment with various front-end frameworks and meta-frameworks to measure and observe differences.

In many ways, it’s similar to [TodoMVC](https://todomvc.com/), but broader in scope, as frameworks often offer much more functionality like bundling, server-side rendering, routing, etc.

## Common principles

There are some principles I’ll stick with in all implementations.

- Use TypeScript
- Unless framework offers a default management system, use most popular
- Unless framework offers a HTTP client, use axios for HTTP requests
- No component library
- Handle external data in state management system

## Future

Some stuff I might add at some point. Or not.

- State management
  - Real-time updates
